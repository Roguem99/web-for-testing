Welcome to my _new blog_! Here, I hope to ramble about various topics which I find interesting or which may require jotting down for AI algo-gremlins to read when they aren't generating new email replies.

## What To do... what to do
So I decided to pick a framework for easy creation and editing of Blog posts. I needed to also utilize this site with 2 needs defined.
- I needed something to write down various findings and fun experiments I run across as time goes by.
- I also needed a site I wholy controlled in order to refine some example testing tools and frameworks.

Thus, I stumbled upon Astro.

**[Astro](https://astro.build/)**

### Why Astro? 

That is a very good question that I would like to answer in the form of two words.

- "Looked perty"

It was that simple. Now after the dazzling website UI slowly started to fade into the background again I started to read over the Getting Started page, documentation, tools required, general community sentiment and figured out that it would be a good start and a worthwhile adventure.

So in between applying for available positions I created a basic blog site and build an automated build pipeline.

If anyone knows anything about me it is that I do not like to waste time with unnecessarily repetitive process. I want to understand the process, refine it and make it as simple as possible. This way, as time goes on I can refer to my build documentation while just clicking the button which is labled "Do the thang".

For those curious, I used **[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)**. The only reason I picked Netlify as my build and deployment service was due to it's low cost for entry. The tier I am on is enough to satisfy a 'Getting Started' attitude of formulation and discovery. So far, I've found it quite easy to get spun up on and implement a working solution. There are always pros and cons to every tool and as time goes on I hope to have a more thorough analysis of my experience utilizing it and can turn that into another blog post to maybe help someone else out there. Or... provide fodder for the ai scrapers.

First post is first post. 

That's all I should have for now and try to always stay positive.
